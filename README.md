**Goal**: Learn Python’s built-in data structures and how to handle files.

- **Daily Time Allocation**:
  - **2 Hours**: Study new concepts.
  - **1 Hour**: Practice coding problems related to data structures.
  - **1 Hour**: Start a project using these data structures.

### Topics:
1. **Lists and Tuples**: Creation, access, and manipulation.
2. **Dictionaries and Sets**: Key-value pairs, uniqueness, basic operations.
3. **File I/O**: Reading/writing text files, handling CSV files.

### Resources:
- Tutorials on **Real Python** or **Python.org** for detailed explanations.

## Week 5-6: Advanced Functions and Error Handling

**Goal**: Deepen understanding of functions, learn error handling, and build modular code.

- **Daily Time Allocation**:
  - **2 Hours**: Learn about functions, lambda, map, filter, and error handling.
  - **1 Hour**: Solve coding challenges involving functions.
  - **1 Hour**: Work on a mini-project applying these concepts.

### Topics:
1. **Advanced Functions**: Lambda functions, `map`, `filter`, and list comprehensions.
2. **Modules**: Creating and using modules, organizing code.
3. **Error Handling**: `try-except`, creating custom exceptions.

### End-of-Week Project:
- **Week 5**: Simple math quiz app with custom scoring.
- **Week 6**: File parser that handles various file formats (with error handling for invalid formats).

## Week 7-8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Goal**: Understand OOP concepts and implement Python classes.

- **Daily Time Allocation**:
  - **2 Hours**: Study and experiment with OOP principles.
  - **1 Hour**: Solve exercises related to OOP.
  - **1 Hour**: Build a small project using OOP.

### Topics:
1. **Classes and Objects**: Attributes, methods, `__init__` constructor.
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Parent and child classes.
3. **Encapsulation**: Private and public attributes.

### End-of-Week Project:
- **Week 7**: Inventory system using classes for different product types.
- **Week 8**: Bank account management system with classes for different account types.

## Week 9-10: SOLID Principles and Introduction to Design Patterns

**Goal**: Apply SOLID principles in Python, and start with common design patterns.

- **Daily Time Allocation**:
  - **2 Hours**: Study SOLID principles with code examples.
  - **1 Hour**: Implement each principle through focused exercises.
  - **1 Hour**: Learn and implement basic design patterns.

### Topics:
1. **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.
2. **Basic Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method, and Strategy patterns.

### Resources:
- **Design Patterns** books and SOLID principle tutorials (e.g., Real Python or online articles).

### End-of-Week Project:
- **Week 9**: Implement a messaging app with classes that follow SOLID principles.
- **Week 10**: Build a simple game or utility app using design patterns.

## Week 11-12: Real-World Application and Final Project

**Goal**: Develop a full-fledged application that combines everything learned.

- **Daily Time Allocation**:
  - **1 Hour**: Review and reinforce previous concepts.
  - **3 Hours**: Work on a capstone project, building it incrementally each day.

### Capstone Project:
- **Web Application**: Build a to-do list or expense tracker app using Flask (or Django if you’re interested in a more extensive framework).
  - Use OOP, SOLID principles, and design patterns.
  - Implement file handling and error management.
  - Integrate a database (SQLite for simplicity).
  - Add a REST API layer to serve data if you want an extra challenge.

## Additional Tips

1. **Code Reviews**: Share your code on GitHub or with others to get feedback.
2. **Documentation**: Document your code, especially during Weeks 9-12, as this is essential for maintainable code.
3. **Testing**: Learn `unittest` or `pytest` and write test cases for your final project.
